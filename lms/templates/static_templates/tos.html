                    <p><strong>1.1. Services:</strong> We provide educational materials, training modules, webinars, workshops, 
                    events, and cohort-based programmes delivered live or recorded via the Platform 
                    (collectively, the “<strong>Offerings</strong>” or “<strong>Services</strong>”).</p>

                    <p><strong>1.2. Partners:</strong> “<strong>Partners</strong>” means educational institutions, corporate organisations,

                    available to you through the Platform. Completion of a course under a paid subscription 
                    (the “<strong>Certificate Track</strong>”) may, at the discretion of LexconX or the relevant Partner, 
                    result in the issuance of a verified <strong>Certificate of Completion</strong>. Unless otherwise specified, 
                    learners accessing content outside a paid subscription will not be eligible to receive Certificates.</p>

                    <p><strong>1.3. Partner Content:</strong> Some Offerings are created and delivered by independent instructors 
                    or Partner Institutions. Unless expressly stated otherwise, such Partners are responsible for the content 
                    and delivery of their respective Offerings. LexconX is not responsible for and does not endorse Partner 
                    Content unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>

                    <p><strong>1.4. Certificate:</strong> We may issue <strong>Certificates of Completion</strong> for certain Offerings; 
                    unless expressly stated, these certificates are acknowledgements of participation and are not regulated 
                    academic or professional qualifications. Certificates may not represent formal qualifications or professional 
                    accreditation.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Payments, Billing, Subscriptions and Pilot Programmes</h2>

                    <p><strong>5.1. Pricing &amp; Payment:</strong> All fees are displayed at checkout and payable in the indicated 
                    currency, displayed prices are exclusive of taxes unless otherwise indicated. Payments are processed through 
                    third-party payment processors, whose terms also apply. LexconX reserves the right to determine and modify

                    <p><strong>5.2. Authorisation:</strong> You authorise LexconX to charge all applicable fees, taxes, and charges 
                    to your designated payment method. Pre-authorisation of your card may occur to verify validity and available credit.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

                    <p><strong>6.1. Subscription Offerings:</strong> Certain plans provide automatically recurring billing for 
                    ongoing access to specified Offerings (“<strong>Subscription Offerings</strong>”). By subscribing, you authorise 
                    LexconX or its payment processor to automatically charge Subscription Fees at the start of each renewal period 
                    until cancelled.</p>

                    <p><strong>6.2. Free Trials:</strong> Some subscriptions may begin with a one-time free trial period. The 
                    duration and applicable fee for each Subscription Offering are shown at the time of subscription.</p>

                    <p><strong>6.3. Billing Cycle:</strong> Your paid subscription begins on the date of first purchase (after any 
                    free trial) and continues for the subscription term (“<strong>Subscription Period</strong>”), renewing 
                    automatically unless cancelled.</p>

                    <p><strong>6.4. Updating Payment Details:</strong> You must keep your payment information current. Failure to 
                    process payment may lead to suspension of access.</p>

                    settings. Cancellation must be received before renewal to avoid the next charge. For subscriptions with a free 
                    trial, cancellation before trial end prevents the initial fee from being charged.</p>

                    <p><strong>6.6. Refunds and Cancellations:</strong> As Offerings are digital, refunds are not available once 
                    access is granted, except where required by the applicable law or if LexconX cancels an Offering. Refund or 
                    credit requests should be directed to <a href="mailto:support@lexconx.com">support@lexconx.com</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>6.7. Taxes:</strong> You are responsible for applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. Taxes may 
                    be displayed as included or added at checkout.</p>
