                        <p>1.1. We, CMI Legal Solutions Ltd, trading as LexconX ("LexconX", "we", "us" or "our"),
                            incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (Company No. 15121986), with its registered
                            office at HQ, 141–142 Lower Marsh, Waterloo, London, SE1 7AE, respect your privacy and are
                            committed to protecting your personal data and your rights under applicable data protection
                            laws, including the UK General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR") and the Data
                            Protection Act 2018.</p>

                        <p>1.2. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, disclose and safeguard your
                            personal data when you visit our website or application (the "Platform") and use our
                            services (the "Services"). These Services include, without limitation, creating a LexconX
                            account, signing up to receive information about our courses and programmes, browsing
                            courses and programmes offered by LexconX, registering and/or subscribing for courses or
                            events, participating in online learning activities (including attending virtual sessions,
                            accessing course content, completing assessments, viewing results and certificates), and
                            providing feedback following course completion.</p>

                        <p>1.3. Courses accessible through the Platform may be delivered in collaboration with
                            educational institutions, corporate organisations or other professional partners

                            Where enrolment or participation in a course or programme takes place on a third-party
                            platform, the privacy policy of that platform will govern the collection, use and disclosure
                            of your personal data. You will be provided with or directed to the relevant privacy policy
                            at the time of enrolment or when you first access such third-party services. LexconX is not
                            responsible for the privacy practices of such third-party platforms and encourages you to
                            review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.</p>

                        <p>1.4. This Privacy Policy describes how LexconX collects, uses and shares your personal data
                            when you interact directly with the LexconX Platform or when someone interacts with the
                            Platform on your behalf.</p>

                        <p>1.5. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access, browse,
                            register or create an account on the LexconX Platform, enrol in any courses, or submit any
                            information through our online forms.</p>

                        <p>1.6. By using our website or Platform, you confirm that you have read, understood and agreed
                            to this Privacy Policy.</p>
